# gradle-dependency-template
An example template of my commonly used Gradle dependencies (kotlin dsl). This is mostly for personal use but I've made it public in case it helps someone else.  Exclude the dependencies/plugins you don't want and pull in the rest. Add or alter whatever else you want based on your needs. Versions are just the relative latest at the time and should be updated at your discretion. Don't forget to update the project details e.g. group name, version etc. root project name is in settings.gradle.kts
